# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Student Timetable

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I want to make a website that you can sign into and store information needed for the daily life of a student. I want this website to include a schedule option, a GPA option, and a semester grade calculator. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
I plan on doing a website similiar to the homepage assignment that was recently assigned. I will be using html, Css, and Javascript to allow a student to store information that they would need for everday life. On the other hand, I would want a student to be allowed to use this website over multiple semesters. I want to include portions of the website where they could calculate their grades for the semester as well as their GPA. As the semester goes on, they will be able to store the grades. I plan on doing a lot of research on Javascript to allow me to do math functions to calculate grades. For the scheduler, I will be using input boxes to create events in the calendar. I will be using CSS to set up the calendar, however, I will be doing more research on how to add these events. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
No, I will be starting this project from scratch. 

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

No, I am working alone

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I really hope to accomplish the login page and the scheduler for this project. I believe this will be a good project where I will learn a lot about making a website and using JavaScript. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The better outcome will include a GPA calculator that students can use for their grades. I think this would be an extremely beneficial tool to everyone. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be to include the scheduler, the GPA calculator, and the grade predictor in my website. I think all of these tools would be helpful for any student. I know there are a lot of GPA calculators out there, however, the websites do not allow you to save your infomformation and test different outputs. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I have learned a lot in watching the videos about creating a webpage such as page design, text, pictures, buttons, etc. I plan on using all of these skills in my project, however, I will need to take this further to complete the project. I need to research information on setting up the calendar in CSS and how to add/delete events when the student needs to. I also need to research more on input boxes so that different options will be applied to the website. Finally, I need to research more information on JavaScript and how to do mathmatical equations that will allow me to calculate the GPA or grades.
