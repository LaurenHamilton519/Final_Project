# Preproposal
Lauren Hamilton

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
I have been doing a lot of work with python and cancer research with the Kumar Lab this semester. I would love to create a program that will analyze data and create graphs to visualize the results. I am still throwing around ideas on what I will do on the official analysis. I also plan to find cancer data from published papers that I can use to test this program. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
No, I am not working with anyone.

## Do you have any questions of your own?
How much would I need to do for a project such as this one for it to qualify as a final project.
